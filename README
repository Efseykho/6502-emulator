This is a collection of tools and utilities to emulate an Atari system.
The ultimate goal here is to implement a full-on atari emulator to run
on a fuzebox ( http://ladyada.net/make/fuzebox/index.html ).

Each folder below here is a seperate project.
There's a README in each project below

Currently we have:
*6502-cpu-emulator - emulator for the 6502 cpu. It is mostly done

Short-term future:
* I've always wanted to mess with assemblers/linkers and existing 6502
assemblers are very hard to use so I'll write my own. And yes, it is 
just an excuse to mess around.

* Visualization of 6502-cpu core in action; written in sdl. And yes, it
is just an excuse to mess with sdl, although it'll be real pretty to look at.


History:

Checked in base skel for 6502 assembler. Currently, it cant assemble anything.

Finished 6502 assembler/linker. All basic instr/gotos are compileable. 
Implemented first necessary macro - DCB. Added a few examples of
progs I can compile to the /progs dir.
