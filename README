This is my first attempt at a 6502 emulator.
This is basically an attempt at re-implementing the c0dez found at:

http://www.6502asm.com/

and,

http://e-tradition.net/bytes/6502/


There are other such emulators. This one is mine!

Currently it implements the whole instruction set of the 6502 chip. Memory accesses
are not trapped or checked in any way. Also, no timing limits are enforced;
the instructions are executed as fast as they go and there's no enforcement of instr
timings.

For now, I've checked in my whole workspace; the development is done using CodeLite,
on a windows boxen, x86-endiannes. Other-endiannes not supported and WILL NOT work.

The next step is to add memory-mapped/PIO devices and emulate those. 
The goal for this thing was two-fold: having me learn assembly and see if it would 
be possible to implement a full-on atari emulator to run on a fuzebox
(http://ladyada.net/make/fuzebox/index.html).

I still think its possible.


*******************
Outstanding issues:

*******************
- stubbed out memory accesses
- instr timings not implemented
- add doxygen comments
- add makefile(?)

First pulled up and hosted on github. Created README.txt
Please be gentle with it; it has sensitive feelings!
